							<p>By the term Public Speaking, it not only means giving a meeting presentation or hosting a show, it means communicating. You must know how to express yourself the way you want to. A person who cannot express oneself can be often misunderstood. They are not convincing at their workplace, at their home to the spouse or children.

It can help you manage the direction you want your career to take, the job skills and knowledge you will need, and how you can get them. The form of your career strategy will depend on the kind of person you are. It may be very structured, or you may just need a few notes in each area - such as knowledge, skills and qualities, what you like doing and the type of jobs that interest you.</p>

Attention, problem solving, planning, arithmetic, reading, memorizing, facial recognition, working memory, inference, verbal or constructional fluency (how fast you can make stuff up), language comprehension, speech and visual motor abilities, sensory perception, constructional abilities (drawing), organizing, decision making are all some activities that tests our cognitive intelligence.</p>

It ensures that you are channelling your time, energy and efforts into things that really matter to you. It makes you live more consciously. All too often we find ourselves just doing something, but doing without any forethought, without any plan, without any overarching strategy. They provide context to our actions.</p>

							<p>You know what you like and what you’re good at. But do you ever find it tricky to tell others about your skills when you’re put under pressure? It happens to lots of people, especially when it comes to filling out application forms for college and attending interviews. This is why it’s a good idea to figure out your skill set. Success in life comes from having the foundation on which you can build new skill sets as needed. Skill analysis helps you understand your praiseworthy aspects and shortcomings. </p>

Without it, continuous improvement which is the stairway to success is impossible. Awareness is the most important state a person can achieve. Awareness leads to intelligence and wisdom. It bridges the gap between ignorance and knowledge. Our primary focus is to make you completely aware of yourself.</p>
